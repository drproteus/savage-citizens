# Rachael Savage for Mayor!
## _Our Campaign Starts Now._

Our Campaign Starts Now.


Itâ€™s 2025. We have all been patient. It is now four years after the pandemic re-opening and we are at the end of one full term with Bruce Harrell as Mayor. The city is still not arresting late stage fentanyl addicts and the untreated mentally ill who are still using drugs, committing crimes and living in the streets of Seattle. These preventable street conditions are destroying our businesses. The destruction of hundreds of businesses is driving our cities tax base into the ground. The constant presence and unpredictable nature of those suffering from addiction and mental illness threaten the safety and harm the dignity of everyone who lives in, works in and visits Seattle. 


We can save Downtown, the International District, Capitol Hill, First Hill, Queen Anne, Pioneer Square and Ballard if we dramatically change the way that we have tried to help the addicted and the mentally ill. We can have a city free from the death, dereliction and cruelty that current policy is creating. 


We can immediately stop using the streets and buildings of our city to run experimental addiction and housing models.

We can return the police and the courts to their proper role of firmly moving the addicted towards change and rejoining society. 

We can create a new, state of the art system of care, away from our city neighborhoods that will change the outcome for the citizens and businesses and for those who are suffering from addiction and mental illness.    

We have a historic opportunity to end the conditions that have been holding Seattle back. We can become a world class civilized city. It can be done.

Bruce Harrell has not accomplished this task. The Democrats have not accomplished this task. To build our city for this century we need a new leader. A leader who as a small business owner has suffered first hand the direct consequences of attempting to treat and to house the addicted and the mentally ill in our city neighborhoods. A leader who has thirty four years of personal and professional experience in addiction recovery. Who, in the process of helping thousands of others to find recovery, understands what enabling addiction looks like. A leader who recognizes that we will need direct help from the federal government and that those in power who share our goal of safe, prosperous cities are our true friends, regardless of party affiliation. 

We need a leader not afraid to take action. Rachael Savage is willing to say what needs to be said and do what needs to be done to save the city she loves. She needs your help.
